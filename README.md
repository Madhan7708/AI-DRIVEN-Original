📘 AI-DRIVEN BEHAVIORAL AND MOTION-BASED CONTROL OF ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES

🧠 Overview

This project implements an AI-powered smart home system that automatically controls electrical appliances based on motion/behavior detection and environmental data. The system uses sensors and a machine learning model to detect presence and patterns, then decides when to turn on/off appliances like lights, fans, etc., for comfort and energy efficiency.

Key features:

Real-time occupancy/motion detection

AI decision-making using sensor data

Smart control of electrical appliances via relays

Logging and analytics for behavior patterns

🚀 Features

✨ Intelligent Decision Making
The system uses AI/ML to learn patterns of behavior and trigger appliances accordingly (e.g., turn on lights when motion is detected and it’s dark).

🔌 Appliance Control
Interface to relay modules or IoT actuators to switch devices on/off.

📊 Sensor Integration
Collects data from:

Motion sensors

Light sensors

Temperature/humidity if present

📈 Energy-Efficient Automation
Only turns appliances on when needed, reducing unnecessary power usage.
